    "A technique involving reidentifying data about someone that had previously been anonymized, given that there is other additional data about that person that's available. This involves using data linkage. Examples include taking anonymized data from the Netflix Prize, and using data available on IMDb to reidentify subjects in the Netflix data.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Input Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Homomorphic Encryption (HE)\n",
    "A process that uses public/private key cryptography on data in such a way that various mathematical operations are possible while maintaining the encrypted state of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC)\n",
    "A cryptographic technique similar to HE that allows multiple parties to collaboratively compute a function over their private inputs, without revealing anything besides the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Input Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cryptographic Signature\n",
    "A cryptographic scheme for verifying the authenticity of a message or document. A common example is the HTTPS protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)\n",
    "A method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that they know a value x, without conveying any information apart from the fact that they know the value x.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Output Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Differential Privacy (DP)\n",
    "A technique that adds noise to the output of any calculation in order to protect privacy. More specifically, it aims to prevent someone from knowing whether a particular individual's data is present in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Privacy Budget (ùúñ)\n",
    "Used in differential privacy, ùúñ is a measure of how much your data stands out, and therefore also a quantifiable measure of:\n",
    "* privacy risk\n",
    "* how likely it is that your data is going to be identified\n",
    "* How much your data affects the outcome of the query or algorithm\n",
    "* How much noise is needed to hide your data's influence\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Private Information Retrieval (PIR)\n",
    "A cryptographic protocol that allows a user to retrieve specific information from a database without revealing which information they are accessing. In other words, PIR enables private and anonymous querying of a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Output Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Argument of Knowledge (SNARK or zk-SNARK)\n",
    "A SNARK is a specific type of Zero Knowledge Proof that focuses on proving that you know a specific secret without revealing any information about the secret itself (i.e. unlike a traditional ZKP, you aren't trying to prove the validity of a statement- just trying to prove that you know it). \"zk-SNARK\" is short for \"zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-Interactive Proof of Work (NI-PoW)\n",
    "A cryptographic construct used to prove that a certain amount of computational effort has been expended without requiring any interaction or challenge from a verifier. In other words, it allows a party (the prover) to demonstrate that they have performed a significant amount of computational work without needing someone else (the verifier) to ask for proof or validate it in real-time."
